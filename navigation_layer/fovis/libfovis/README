About this project
==================

Name:         libfovis
Authors:      Albert Huang <ashuang@gmail.com>

Summary:      Visual odometry with a depth camera (e.g., Kinect/Primesense) or
              stereo camera.

Requirements:

  CMake       (http://www.cmake.org)
  Eigen 3     (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)

  Fovis was developed on Ubuntu, but may work with other platforms.


Build Instructions
==================

For system-wide installation:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ sudo make install
  $ sudo ldconfig

  This usually installs Fovis to /usr/local or something like that.

For use in the source directory:

  $ mkdir build
  $ make


Intel SSE
---------
  By default, Fovis is configured to use Intel SSE2 and SSE3 instructions.  You
  can disable this option (e.g., if you're targeting a platform without those
  instructions) by using the CMake option USE_SSE:

  $ cd build
  $ cmake .. -DUSE_SSE=OFF
  $ make


Documentation
=============

  Fovis is documented using Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org).  To build the documentation:

  $ cd doc
  $ doxygen

  Following that, open up doc/html/index.html in your web browser.
